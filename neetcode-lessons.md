Data Structures: 
Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
Trees (binary trees, AVL trees, red-black trees)
Heaps and priority queues
Hash tables
Graphs (adjacency lists, adjacency matrices)

Sorting and Searching Algorithms:
Quick sort, merge sort, heap sort
Binary search, depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS)

Dynamic Programming:
Principles and common patterns (e.g., memoization, tabulation)
Classic problems (e.g., knapsack problem, longest common subsequence)

Graph Algorithms:
Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford)
Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal's, Prim's)
Network flow algorithms (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp)

Greedy Algorithms:
Techniques and classic problems (e.g., Huffman coding, activity selection)

Advanced Algorithmic Techniques:
Backtracking (e.g., N-Queens problem)
Divide and conquer (e.g., merge sort, quicksort)
Randomized algorithms (e.g., randomized quicksort, Monte Carlo methods)
