## Introduction
This repository aims to provide a practical introduction to deep neural networks (DNN) and extend your understanding of cutting-edge technology and concepts in the deep learning (DL) field. The hands-on exercises will help you apply neural networks to computer vision (CV) tasks, natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and domains with structured data.

## Prerequisites
To make the most of this repository, you should have a solid understanding of:
- Multivariate calculus
- Linear algebra
- Probability and statistics
- Python programming

Prior experience with neural networks or machine learning, along with familiarity with data munging, numerical linear algebra, machine learning (ML), and visualization libraries, is highly recommended.
