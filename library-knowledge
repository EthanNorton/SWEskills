Here are some library areas that I want to explore more in depth.


-CuDF and Nvidia learning applications 
	-NIMS
	-Distributed/Parallel Computers 
	-Try CUDNN

-Understanding Tensors 
	- Build a neural network for looking at predicting energy levels 
	- Understanding one hot encoding for this 
	- Understand gradient descent optimizer
