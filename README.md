# SWE skills and foundations

To be a better data scientist and to manage code effectively, I am focusing on developing software engineering (SWE) skills. These practices should be apparent throughout my other coding repositories.

## Goals and Coding Principles

1. As I work in various teams, the code should be easily interpreted by all team members.
2. The code is reproducible, clean, well documented, and digested by myself from each line, not a spew of an LLM/anyone else.
3. Understandable scalability of code, as well as System Design.

## Areas of Focus
Each of these should be considered a mini-book with research articles that give a strong theoretical and applicable foundation. I will reference examples of various repositories that I build.

### 1. Learning Code Quality and Maintainability

- **Clean Code**:
  - **Topics**: "Towards Better Code: A Journey Through the State of the Art of Code Quality" by Emanuele Panichella et al.
      - 1.
  - **Practice**: Write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
  
- **The Pragmatic Programmer**:
  - **Topics**: "Pragmatic Software Development: Enabling Agility through Design and Analysis" by Ivan Porres
  - **Practice**: Follow practical advice for various aspects of software development.

- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Topics**: OOP, Encapsulation, Functional Programming, 
     - 1. https://assets.ptidej.net/Publications/Documents/IST23.doc.pdf
  - **Practice**: Utilize common design patterns to solve recurring design problems.

- **Code Reviews and Pair Programming**:
  - **Topics**: Participate in code reviews and pair programming to learn from more experienced developers.

- **Open Source Contributions**:
  - **Practice**: Contribute to open-source projects to engage with high standards of code quality and maintainability.

### 2. Learning Scalability and Performance

- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**:
  - **Topics**: "Architectural Patterns and Techniques for Scalable, Reliable, and Maintainable Applications" by Martin Fowler
  - **Practice**: Understand the architecture of scalable systems and how to handle large datasets efficiently.

- **High Performance Browser Networking**:
  - **Topics**: "Performance Optimization Strategies for Web Applications" by Ilya Grigorik
  - **Practice**: Learn performance optimization techniques, especially for web applications.

- **Performance Profiling and Optimization**:
  - **Tools**: Use profilers like `gprof`, `Valgrind`, and language-specific profilers.
  - **Practice**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize code performance.

- **System Design**:
  - **Topics**: "System Design for Scalability and Performance" by Jeffrey Dean and Luiz André Barroso
  - **Practice**: Participate in mock system design interviews to practice designing scalable architectures.

### General Principles

- **SOLID Principles**: These five principles are fundamental for writing maintainable and scalable code.
  - **S**: Single Responsibility Principle
  - **O**: Open/Closed Principle
  - **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle
  - **I**: Interface Segregation Principle
  - **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle
