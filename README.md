# SWE skills and foundations

To be a better data scientist and to manage code effectively, I am focusing on developing software engineering (SWE) skills. These practices should be apparent throughout my other coding repositories.

## Goals and Coding Principles

1. As I work in various teams, the code should be easily interpreted by all team members.
2. The code is reproducible, clean, well documented, and digested by myself from each line, not a spew of an LLM/anyone else.
3. Understandable scalability of code, as well as System Design.

## Areas of Focus
Each of these should be considered a mini-book with research articles that give a strong theoretical and applicable foundation. I will reference examples of various repositories that I build.
